## üí° Inspiration

Our motivation to build GasLockR emanated from three predominant on-chain challenges:

### 1. Reliability

- **Inconsistent Experience**: The unpredictable nature of gas prices has made it challenging for blockchain platforms to deliver a consistent and usable quality of service.
- **Unforeseen Spikes**: Occasional surges in gas prices can render even Layer 2 solutions temporarily unusable, shaking the trust of users in the blockchain infrastructure.

### 2. Onboarding

- **Initial Token Requirement**: New users face a significant entry barrier as they need to possess tokens upfront to cover gas fees before they can engage in swaps or any other on-chain interactions.

- **Chicken-and-Egg Dilemma**: This initial requirement creates a paradox where users need funds to start an on-chain journey, considerably slowing down the onboarding process.

### 3. UX

- **Gas Fee Management**: Users find themselves constantly having to monitor and select the right gas fees, turning every transaction into a cumbersome task.

- **Complexity for Newcomers**: Such intricacies can be particularly daunting for newcomers, detracting from the essence of Web3 and potentially deterring wider adoption.

## üöÄ Solution

We have developed GasLockR to provide a robust solution to the outlined challenges:

### 1. Gas Pricing Model

Our advanced Gas Pricing Model forms the backbone of GasLockR. Here is how it works:

- **ZK Coprocessor for Historical Gas Price**: This component helps us access historical gas prices, which is crucial in understanding past trends and predicting future gas costs.
- **Transaction Pool Monitor**: It provides real-time block information, allowing us to stay updated with the latest on-chain events and activities.
- **External Oracle for Gas Information**: We employ an external oracle to retrieve gas information, ensuring accurate and timely data for our calculations.
- **Market Events**: Taking into account market events, our model factors in the dynamic nature of the blockchain environment. It can account for significant market events that might cause abrupt changes in gas prices.

Incorporating these elements, we generate a Gas Pricing Model that efficiently determines the pricing for our insurance model.

### 2. Anti-risk GasFi Services

Our Anti-risk GasFi services aim to alleviate the concerns of volatile gas prices:

- **Correctly Priced**: Leveraging the aforementioned Gas Pricing Model, we ensure that our services are correctly priced, reflecting the true cost and risk involved.
- **Automatic Execution**: We employ Chainlink's automation capabilities to monitor on-chain events and automatically execute insurance payouts when necessary.
- **Hedge Volatile Gas Price**: Our services provide an efficient way for users to hedge against the risk of rising gas prices, making blockchain services more reliable and predictable.
- **Payment Flexibility**: Users can pay for our services using both Fiat and ERC20 tokens, providing more flexibility and convenience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

Our approach recognizes the different needs of blockchain users. Thus, we've introduced two distinct solutions tailored for diverse user requirements:

### 1. GasInsure: Insurance Against Gas Price Volatility

GasInsure offers a way for users to protect themselves against unpredictable and often high gas prices.

#### For the Average User:

- **Simplicity**: Purchase a gas price insurance with straightforward terms.
- **Peace of Mind**: During the insurance's active period, the gas price surges past a predefined limit, the insurance takes effect. Here's the best part: users receive compensation automatically, shielding them from the brunt of unexpected gas fee hikes. Please note: The insurance provides a one-time payout once the threshold is crossed.

#### For the Advanced User:

- **Multi-Layered Strategy**: Advanced users have the flexibility to purchase multiple insurance packages. This not only amplifies potential returns but also offers a strategic advantage in hedging against volatile gas prices.
- **Hands-Free Protection**: There's no need for actual dApp interactions. If the gas price breaches the stipulated boundary, our system kicks in, ensuring that compensation is dispatched without any manual claims or interventions.
- **Strategic Hedging**: This offering is designed for those who have an eye on the bigger picture. By predicting potential gas price spikes and hedging proactively, advanced users can navigate the volatile crypto landscape with increased financial security.

### 2. GasSubscribe: A Subscription for Smooth DApp Interactions

Taking inspiration from conventional mobile data plans, GasSubscribe revolutionizes the way users experience blockchain.

- **User-Centric Subscription**: Choose the duration and enjoy gas-senseless interactions with dApps. No more worrying about fluctuating gas prices with every transaction.
- **DApp Integration**: DApps can offer seamless experiences by subscribing on behalf of their users. This eliminates the friction of gas fees, making onboarding new users simpler than ever.
- **Account Abstraction at Its Best**: With GasSubscribe, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible. By leveraging account abstraction techniques, we've made it so that users don't even have to think about gas fees. It's all handled in the background, offering a smooth, web2-like experience in the decentralized world.

## üèÜ Insurance Pricing Models

We have gathered daily Ethereum gas prices over the past year and have conducted volatility analyses for both 15-day and 30-day periods.

### 1. Model 1: Normal Backtest Model

#### Overview

This model calculates an insurance policy price based on the maximum price increase observed over a sliding window of gas prices.

#### Key Components:

- **Sliding Window**: Considers a set number of days (e.g., 15) to determine the price trend.
- **Max Rise Calculation**: Determines the maximum relative increase in gas prices over the window.
- **Policy Price Determination**: Based on the maximum rise and an expected payout amount, the insurance policy price is calculated.

#### Formulae:

- **Max Rise**:
  - Max Rise = Max( price[i] / price[i-1] - 1 )
- **Trigger Price for Payout**:
  - Trigger Price = currentPrice \* (1 + Max Rise)
- **Policy Price**:

  - Policy Price = expectedPayout \* 1.15

#### Backtest results

### 2. Model 2: Binary Backtest Model

#### Overview

This model uses a binary option approach to calculate the insurance policy price, incorporating both upward and downward price factors.

#### Key Components:

- **Upward & Downward Price Factors**: `u` and `d` are factors for calculating potential upward and downward price movements.
- **Risk Neutral Probability**: Represents the equal likelihood of price going up or down.
- **Option Pricing Tree**: A tree structure calculates the policy price, considering both early exercise and continuation values.

#### Formulae:

- **Upward Movement**:
  - Price \* u
- **Downward Movement**:
  - Price \* d
- **Trigger Price for Payout**:
  - Trigger Price = currentPrice \* 1.1
- **Option Price**:
  - Uses the binary tree structure to determine the highest value between early exercise or continuation.
